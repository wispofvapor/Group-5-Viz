# Group-5-Viz
Group 5 Visualization and Tools Project - Fall 2021
DA 6233 Fall 2021 Final Project Guidelines and Grading Rubric
The critical objective of the final project is to self-evaluate whether you can apply the tools 
you learned in this course to real-life problems. The best way you can achieve this is by 
replicating a dashboard that is already available.
1. Select a dashboard you saw in the wild and really liked. For example, it could be the 
Covid-19 tracker by JHU: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html. There are many such 
dashboard available from publications such as the New York Times, ProPublica, Wall 
Street Journal, the Economist, Financial Times, Guardian, etc. Alternatively, you can 
check out Tableau gallery of publicly available dashboards. In short, there is no 
shortage of dashboards!
However, you need not blindly replicate a dashboard that may be irrelevant for your 
use case. For instance, a Covid-19 tracker at the global level might be too broad for 
you. Perhaps, you want to create a dashboard that serves Bexar county. You can use 
the ideas from a broader dashboard like JHU’s to create your own Bexar county Covid 
19 tracker. Additionally, you may use any of the data sets that I have shared on Github 
to create your dashboard.
2. Determine the data requirement for your dashboard. This can be challenging and 
might take some time. However, many public dashboards also share their data sets 
publicly through Github. If they don’t, please think about an alternative data set that 
you can use to recreate that dashboard.
3. Determine the technology requirement for your dashboard. You are free to use 
any software to create the dashboard. However, given that a majority of students are 
learning data visualization for the first time, it might be a good idea to choose from the 
set of tools you are acquiring. R, JS, and Tableau are all good candidates. However, if 
your group feels comfortable with Python, I have no issues with that. Just make sure 
that everyone in the group is onboard.
4. Create your dashboard and share it online freely. Tableau dashboards can be 
hosted on Tableau Public server for free. R dashboards can be freely hosted on RPubs: 
https://rpubs.com.
5. In the final presentation show the functionalities of your dashboard and explain 
how it will be useful to any external constituent such as individuals, businesses, or 
policymakers. 
The final project is worth 40 points. The grading rubric is as follows:
The dashboard evaluation will take into account the following aspects (Higher the better):
1. The technological sophistication of the dashboard
2. The usability and the quality of the user interface of the dashboard
3. The relevance of the dashboard to an external constituent
The final presentation will involve a walkthrough of the dashboard. As the time will be 
limited, groups are expected to show the best aspects of their dashboards. 
Finally, each group member will evaluate all the group members (including themselves) in 
their group. This evaluation will be done independently and confidentially.
